Tip 
- Start timing myself half way through my prep calender
- Aim to spend max 40 mins on a problem
- Always acknowledge in an interview that recursion will use more memory ( What about tail recursion? )
- Ask an interview if its ok to sort an array inplace


Things to revise
- n log(n)
= maybe look at pascals Triangle in python - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pascal-triangle/


### Demonstrate good coding skills with 
- Descriptive variable nameing - Communicate what its use is. See uncle bob 
- Abstracting out code sections and makeing use of helper methods. Multi step algorithms is where this can come in handy. Eg ; a function that removes duplicates for your main goal. 
- Documentation : when the code is none obvious. 
- Descriptive code. 
- Idiomatic codeing style : Each language has a way to be written. Basically Know the language. 
- Testing : Knowing solid tests shows you know . Edge case tests etc. 

### Problem Solving
- Ask clarifying questions, 
- Take time to discover the problem; 
  - Consider alternatives; pros and cons etc.
  - Is there a repeated step I could optimize on?
- Discuss the trade offs. eg recursive solution VS cacheing based solution. Demonstrate critical thinking of your ideas
- Implement/tackle the problem in an organised manner.
- Test Proactively: Explain how you would test it. WHat edge cases, good suite of tests,
